    <summary>Click Here for Short Biography!</summary>
    Chaodit was born in Nakhon-Ratchasima or Korat (gateway province to the northeast region of Thailand). That was in 1973, which seems not very long ago (to me).
    
    His early education started in Anuban-Meung Nakhon-Ratchasima, a local public school. From this school, it took 8 years before little Chaodit had learnt enough of Thai/English/Math languages. He then continued his study in another local school, Rajsima Vittayalai, where he met the girl (now his wife and the mother of our little daughter). After five years in this school, he passed the entrance examination and became a freshy in the Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University. He then moved from his home town, as a country boy, to the capital city of Thailand.
    
    Four years to learn the inventive ideas by Newton, Maxwell and Faraday (amongst other giants). In 1994, he obtained the Bachelor of Engineering degree with 1st-class honours in Electrical Engineering. His major was in communication engineering and his final-year project was "Amorphous SiC Photocoupler" under the supervision of Prof. Dusit Krua-ngam.
    
    From 1995 to 2000, he was with Digital Communication Section as well as Communication and Signal Processing Research Group, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, University of London. At the college, he worked under the supervision of Dr Javier Barria in the area of communications networking. His research topic was "Performance Analysis of Routing in ATM Networks with Non-linear Equivalent Capacity Functions". He was awarded the PhD degree from the University of London on 31 December 2000 (the last day of the previous millennium).
    
    Dr Chaodit is currently an assistant professor in Electrical Engineering at Chulalongkorn University. He previously served as the coordinator of Communication System Basic Laboratory and is a member of Telecommunication System Research Laboratory (TSRL). With Dr Chaiyachet Saivichit, we are now leading the Network Research Group of TSRL with more than 15 members of quality staff. Dr Chaodit is also a researcher in the University's Intelligent Transport System (ITS) Group, recently founded to raise the quality of transportation and traffic systems to their highest standards. And he is serving as the Assistant Head of Department in Academic Affairs, responsible for supervising the postgraduate programs at the Electical Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University.
