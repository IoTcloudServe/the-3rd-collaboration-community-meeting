Future Internet evolution with the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) has already shed light upon a huge potential as connected-society enablement. With the exponential growth of IoT, a scaleable data-centric IoT system by sharing the physical resources across services or workloads is needed to support the huge data collection and processing from various IoT devices. To investigate this challenge together in TEIN community, this “Data-Centric IoT-Cloud Service Platform for Smart Communities (IoTcloudServe@TEIN)” project has been instantiated within the umbrella of Asi@Connect with the following objectives:
    
- To design, develop, and operate a centralized IoT-cloud service platform site (called “IoTcloudServe@TEIN”) in Thailand, that is accessible over TEIN communities with the supports from the OF@TEIN+ underlay network infrastructure.

- To demonstrate the usefulness of the developed IoTcloudServe@TEIN by running three data-centric IoT-cloud services in two selected TEIN sites, namely, Smart-Energy/Mobility@Chula (Chulalongkorn University, Thailand) and Smart-Agriculture@NUOL (National University of Laos).

In this completion of the IoTcloudServe@TEIN project, this 3rd collaboration community meeting is intended to share in TEIN communities and collaborating partners important lessons learnt. Here, the Smart-Energy/Smart-Mobility@Chula and Smart-Agriculture@NUOL sites will be demonstrated together with the container-based orchestrating system provisioned by the IoTcloudServe@TEIN testbed infrastructure. At the finale, potential participants are encouraged to discuss upon possible further collaboration in the upcoming Open Federated Playgrounds for AI-Inspired SmartX Services (OF@TEIN++) by utilizing the learnt lessons and established IoTcloudServe@TEIN playground.
